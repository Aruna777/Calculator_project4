# Calculator_project4

Welcome Note:

The project Calculator App with Expression Persistency is an extension to the calculator with Expression History. In this project, I practiced MVVM and Database Locally. The user can also clear the history using the clear history button on the history page. Once the user clears the history, it also gets deleted from the database.
